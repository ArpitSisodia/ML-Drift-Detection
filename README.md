# ML-Drift-Detection

many of the drift detection & retraining techniques:
Active approach- where retraining happens only when drift is detected in data.
Passive approach- when continuous retraining happens assuming drift is always present in data. 
 
many approaches also detect warning zone along with 'if there is drift or not.
